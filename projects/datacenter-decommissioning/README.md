# üè¢ Datacenter Decommissioning Guide & Project Walkthrough

This documentation outlines the steps and practices followed during the full decommissioning of a production datacenter. It serves as both a **reference guide** for future decommissioning tasks and a **retrospective** of how the project was successfully executed.

---

## üìå Overview

- **Project Duration:** April 3rd ‚Äì April 16th, 2025  
- **Scope:** Decommissioning of 141 chassis servers and 30 network switches across multiple racks  
- **Goal:** Safely power down, remove, document, and prepare hardware for transport or disposal, with full inventory tracking.

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Preparation
- Reviewed asset inventory and rack layout documentation
- Identified targets (servers, switches, optics, cables)
- Set up SmartSheet tracking
- Prepared tools: labels, zip ties, electric screwdrivers, (bubble wrap, trolleys, pallet from logistics team)

### 2. Power Down & Disconnect
- Followed standard shutdown procedures
- Removed power/network cables
- Confirmed systems offline before removal

### 3. Hardware Removal
- Logical rack-by-rack removal
- Extracted optics and sensitive parts
- Reusable parts separated from scrap

### 4. Packaging
- Wrapped items with bubble wrap
- Grouped and labeled by cabinet/rack
- Placed on pallets for transport

### 5. Documentation
- Logged devices in SmartSheet (serial numbers, chassis numbers, origin, type, labels)
- Scrap and cable documentation maintained

### 6. Cable & Material Cleanup
- Organized LAN/fiber in overhead trays
- Stored spare parts and loose materials inside a dedicated area.

### 7. Finalization
- Site cleared
- All pallets are labeled and stored 
- Area handed to the logistics team for shipment
