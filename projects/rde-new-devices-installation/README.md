## üìå Project Overview

- **Location:** Bad Kreuznach, Germany  
- **Duration:** 24.03.2025 ‚Äì 28.03.2025  
- **Total Duration:** 5 working days  
- **Devices Installed:**  
  - 6x Cisco C9300-48UXM switches  
  - 24x Wireless Access Points (APs)  
  - 7x Network module (upgraded for fiber SFP-10 compatibility)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Scope of Work

- Installed 6 Cisco switches in separate communication rooms  
- Established **fiber uplink** between each comms room and the main network room using cross-connections  
- Followed and executed **patching** based on a predefined patch schedule  
- Troubleshot and replaced incompatible network module in the main network switch to support additional SFP-10 fiber connections  
- Connected and powered 24 APs across the comms rooms via the new switches

---

## üîÑ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Switch Installation
- Mounted 6x Cisco C9300-48UXM in 6 comms rooms  
- Verified rack stability, power supply, and ventilation  
- Configured initial switch settings

### 2. Fiber Uplink Setup
- Installed 2 port network module for fiber connection through SFP
- Connected each switch to the main network room via fiber cables  
- Performed cross-connection as per network topology  
- Verified link lights and tested uplinks

### 3. Patching
- Followed site patching schedule for structured cabling  
- Labeled and organized patch cables to avoid signal overlap or misrouting

### 4. Network Module Replacement
- Initial module was incompatible with the required SFP-10 fiber ports  
- Identified incompatibility during uplink tests  
- Ordered correct compatible module  
- Removed old module, installed and tested new one ‚Äî uplinks successful

### 5. Access Point Connection
- Installed and connected 24 wireless APs  
- Verified PoE delivery and network access  
- Conducted basic connectivity testing
